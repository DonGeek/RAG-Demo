This is in spite of the massive slowdown globally \\ncaused by Covid-19 and a war. The Indian economy is therefore on the right \\ntrack, and despite a time of challenges, heading towards a bright future.  \\n3. \\nToday as Indians stands with their head held high, and the world \\nappreciates India’s achievements and successes, we are sure that elders \\nwho had fought for India’s independence, will with joy, bless us our \\nendeavors going forward. \\nResilience amidst multiple crises \\n4. \\nOur focus on wide-ranging reforms and sound policies, implemented \\nthrough Sabka Prayas resulting in Jan Bhagidari and targeted support to \\nthose in need, helped us perform well in trying times.

Our \\ntax payers’ portal received a maximum of 72 lakh returns in a day; \\nprocessed more than 6.5 crore returns this year; average processing period \\nreduced from 93 days in financial year 13-14 to 16 days now;  \\nand 45 per cent of the returns were processed within 24 hours. We intend \\nto further improve this, roll out a next-generation Common IT Return Form \\nfor tax payer convenience, and also plan to strengthen the grievance \\nredressal mechanism.  \\nMSMEs and Professionals  \\n134. \\nMSMEs are growth engines of our economy.  Micro enterprises with \\nturnover up to ` 2 crore and certain professionals with turnover of up to  \\n` 50 lakh can avail the benefit of presumptive taxation. I propose to provide \\nenhanced limits of ` 3 crore and ` 75 lakh respectively, to the tax payers \\nwhose cash receipts are no more than 5 per cent. Moreover, to support \\nMSMEs in timely receipt of payments, I propose to allow deduction for \\nexpenditure incurred on payments made to them only when payment is \\nactually made.  \\nCooperation \\n135. \\nCooperation is a value to be cherished. In realizing our Prime \\nMinister’s goal of “Sahkar se Samriddhi”, and his resolve to “connect the \\nspirit of cooperation with the spirit of Amrit Kaal”, in addition to the \\nmeasures proposed in Part A, I have a slew of proposals for the co-operative \\nsector.'),\n",

I \\nhave five major announcements to make in this regard. These primarily \\nbenefit our hard-working middle class. \\n146. \\nThe first one concerns rebate. Currently, those with income up to  \\n` 5 lakh do not pay any income tax in both old and new tax regimes. I \\npropose to increase the rebate limit to ` 7 lakh in the new tax regime. Thus, \\npersons in the new tax regime, with income up to ` 7 lakh will not have to \\npay any tax.  \\n147. \\nThe \\nsecond \\nproposal \\nrelates \\nto \\nmiddle-class \\nindividuals. \\n I had introduced, in the year 2020, the new personal income tax regime \\nwith six income slabs starting from ` 2.5 lakh. I propose to change the tax \\nstructure in this regime by reducing the number of slabs to five and \\nincreasing the tax exemption limit to ` 3 lakh. The new tax rates are: \\n` 0-3 lakh \\nNil \\n` 3-6 lakh \\n5 per cent \\n` 6-9 lakh \\n10 per cent \\n` 9-12 lakh \\n15 per cent \\n` 12-15 lakh \\n20 per cent \\nAbove ` 15 lakh \\n30 per cent \\n \\n148. \\nThis will provide major relief to all tax payers in the new regime. An \\nindividual with an annual income of ` 9 lakh will be required to pay only  \\n` 45,000/-. This is only 5 per cent of his or her income. It is a reduction of 25 \\nper cent on what he or she is required to pay now, ie, ` 60,000/-. Similarly, \\nan individual with an income of ` 15 lakh would be required to pay only  \\n` 1.5 lakh or 10 per cent of his or her income, a reduction of 20 per cent \\nfrom the existing liability of ` 1,87,500/.  \\n149. \\nMy third proposal is for the salaried class and the pensioners \\nincluding family pensioners, for whom I propose to extend the benefit of'),\n",

This is among the \\nhighest in the world. I propose to reduce the highest surcharge rate from 37 \\nper cent to 25 per cent in the new tax regime. This would result in reduction \\nof the maximum tax rate to 39 per cent. \\n151. \\nLastly, the limit of ` 3 lakh for tax exemption on leave encashment \\non retirement of non-government salaried employees was last fixed in the \\nyear 2002, when the highest basic pay in the government was ` 30,000/- \\npm.
